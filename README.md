# CSE3311Project
This is our final project in the class CSE 3311.
We will be developing a garage sale application that will allow users to sell items they list, or they can buy/trade items listed by other users.
The application will have a login feature, user profile, watchlist for items, messaging, and search features as well.

If you have not registered for the app, that should be the first thing to do and our database will save your user login.
